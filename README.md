```
and copy idom_installator file from repo. Then enter:
```bash
./idom_installator
```
You need to create mysql database and user with command:
```mysql
create database my_application;
create user 'your_username'@'%' identified by 'your_password
grant all privileges to my_application.* to 'your_username';
```

Next, nano ediot will pop-up. We're recommending using gmail for your application. You need to enter text given below with your's data:
```python
SECRET_KEY = 'Secret key generated by  PBKDF2'
DEBUG = FALSE
DB_NAME = 'my_application'
DB_USER = 'your_database_username'

EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your_gmail_address'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_gmail_password'
EMAIL_PORT = '587'
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
